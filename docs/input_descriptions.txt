General:
* Every field marked with a red star at the left side is a MANDATORY
field which means the whole resource can not be added until valid
information is provided at each mandatory field.

Observatory:

- Web address: 		HAS to be valid URL
- Address: 		self-explanatory
- ZIP code: 		self-explanatory
- City: 		self-explanatory
- Country: 		self-explanatory
- Phone: 		self-explanatory
- Email: 		self-explanatory
- Latitude/Longitude:	The box []''' is hundredth seconds. So if you
			want to enter 23.1'' => [23]'' [10]'''

- Approximate position:		self-explanatory
- Sealevel [m]:			self-explanatory
- Precipitation range [mm/Y]:	If not given just leaf default value.
- Clear nights [D]:		If not given just leaf default value.
- Timezone [GMT+/-]:		self-explanatory

-)Scientific Contacts:	You can add 1-N Scientific Contacts to a
			Observatory Entry, by clicking ADD.
			Removing an Entry is handled by clearing the
			Fields manually

-)Hidden Fields:	You have to hide some of the information!
			At the OLD NA1-Matrix these entries are atm
			indicated as "Not Displayed:" followed (for
			the period of harvesting the old database
			entries) by the information itself.

-)Research Areas:	If you want to add a new Research Area you just
			need to click on "Add other Research Area" and
			a form field pops up.

			You can add 1-N new Research Areas by clicking
			several times on "Add other Research Area".

			Several Research Areas can be added by
			selecting entries while holding the
			key "CTRL or CMD".

-)Targets:		Several Targets can be added by selecting
			entries while holding the key "CTRL or CMD".

-)Instruments:		Diameter HAS to be added in m (meter)
			Focallength can be entered either in meter or
			as focalnumber but needs the addition [... m/F].
			
			Please enter the WAVELENGTH of instruments in the 
			format like given at the "30-meter telescope" example.
			"Domain, exact spectrum"
			If it's a range:
			"Domain_begin, exact spectrum - Domain_end, exact spectrum"
			
			* Radiowaves
  				* LF (Low Frequency)
  				* MF (Medium Frequency)
  				* HF (High Frequency)
  				* VHF (Very High Freqency)
			* Microwaves
  				* UHF (Ultra High Frequency)
  				* SHF (Super High Frequency)
  				* EHF (Extremely High Frequency)
			* Submillimeter waves
			* Infrared radiation
  				* FIR (Far Infrared)
  				* MIR (Mid Infrared)
  			* NIR (Near Infrared)
			* Visible Light
			* UV radiation
			
			You can add 1-N Instruments to a Observatory
			Entry, by clicking ADD.

			You can remove an Instrument by selecting
			"Delete Instrument" in the selecting field.

-)Camera Properties:	MIN / MAX exposure time HAS to be entered in
			seconds. B/W means Black/White.

-)Additional Information:
	When there is information not fitting other input fields it can
	be added to one of these text boxes.

Space Mission:
//----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Space Mission name:		self-explanatory
- Mission Agency:		self-explanatory
- Launch Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]:	self-explanatory
- Death Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]:	self-explanatory
- Web address:			self-explanatory

-)Research Areas:	see Observatory-Research Areas
-)Targets:		see Observatory-Targets

-)Sensor:	A Sensor is linked to 1-N Science Goals, and 1-N
		Scientific Contacts.
		You can add 1-N Sensors for a Space mission.
		May we generate a list of possible "Sensor Types".
		Range BEGIN, Range END MUST be float number.
		Measured, Units must be SELF explaining.

--)Science Goals:	If you want to add a new Science Goal you just
			need to click on "Add other Science Goal" and a
			form field pops up.

			You can add 1-N new Science Goals by clicking
			several times on "Add other Science Goal".

			Several Science Goals can be added by
			selecting entries while holding the
			key "CTRL or CMD".

--)Scientific Contacts:	You can add 1-N Scientific Contacts to a Sensor
			Entry, by clicking ADD.

			Removing an Entry is handled by clearing the
			Fields manually.
