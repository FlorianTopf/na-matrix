BEWARE FOR DUPLICATE FUNCTION/MEMBER/METHOD NAMES TO EPN FRAMEWORK (just to be on the safe side)
* Watch out for MODEL functionality and TABLEFIELD class

* CODING STANDARD!

* HTML 4.01 transitional => XHTML 1.0 strict conversion with validator
	=> target NOT allowed => use JS
	=> HTMLENTITIES < >
	=> table oder ul ist nicht ohne tr bzw. li erlaubt
	=> div inline definition ist nicht erlaubt (divs for ps)
	=> [] in input names are not allowed!
* CSS 2.1 validation (refactor css, original rev384, rev393)
	=> define standard paragraph (p)
	=> Z-INDEX gelöscht (siehe typo3)


* Removed comments in VIEWS (rev391)

* Implement delete_resource() in spacemission model (implement delete button for admins)

* Put FIREFOX/JS recommendation in footer
  * MODEL has to be proof if javascript is OFF (check with browser)

* PRESENTATION:
  * remove functionality for science goals for the moment (add, show, spacemission)

* DOCUMENTATION:
  * update input_descriptions.txt (new research areas, more description)
  * Doxygen Information for new library classes etc.


* Running Database
  * Review Science Goals (Robert, Manuel)
   * Rewrite entries of europlanet_na1 database
 	 * comments to new fields (remove unnecessary comment fields:
 	    instrument comments)
 	 * old telescope types to new instrument types


* Development Database
  * improve hidden fields / additional information (remove not necessary)
  * remove OTHER from Telescope Types / Instrument Types / Antenna Types!
  * introduce JOINS where necessary and usable


** Introduce Questionnaire form (entries must be approved afterwards) (JUNE 2011)
  * very user friendly! tooltips necessary (UI)
  * switch of all OTHER options (research areas etc.)
  * maybe modify database (use a second one OR make flags)
  * implement a state-of-the-art CAPTCHA

* Input form for observatories
  * add other targets (db functionality)
  * error labels for diameter (and other inputs) must be better!
  * wavelength (written text? like radio, near-infrared..)
    * autocompleter + db table (acronym / name) [OK]
    * take only necessary jquery UI scripts + css (fix it!)
    * DOESNT WORK when something is already in the input field (maybe because of missing delimiter ",")
  * spatial resolution => format?
  * spectral resolution => format?
  * remove last telescope => empty fields
  * remove last instrument => empty fields
  * PARTNER OBSERVATORIES => make intelligent linkage! (e.g. autocompleter)
  * reorder comment fields locations in input form!

* Input validation in JQUERY for observatories (see comments in add.php)
  * other target - MANDATORY!
  * telescope name - MANDATORY?
  * telescope type - MANDATORY?
  * instrument name - MANDATORY?
  * instrument type - MANDATORY?
  * check for type of values (critical review)!


* Input form for space missions
  * add other targets (db functionality)
  * sensor type? => dropdown from PDAP types? -> extensible?
  * field of view, resolution, measured => format?
  * range_begin, range_end => high precision float?
  * remove last sensor => empty fields
  * Add validation for OTHER science goals with inline error label
  * autocompleter for sensor type

* Input validation in JQUERY for space missions (see comments in add.php)
  * other target - MANDATORY!
  * sensor name - MANDATORY (array => THIS IS AN OPEN ISSUE!)
  * science goals are MANDATORY! (required)
  * validation for sensor web_address (URL)
  * check for type of values (critical review)!

* ALL INPUT FORMS:
  * Add validation for existing names for all OTHER
  * Implement brief description for research areas


** Browsing pages for observatories
  * according to telecon inputs (standard / detail pages)
  * colorization of different observatories
  * show creation / modification date
  * links to the partner observatories (how to manage this?)
  * filter: country, telescope type

** Browsing pages for space missions
  * according to telecon inputs (standard / detail pages)
  * don't forget to display agencies details
  * colorization of different agencies
  * show creation / modification date
  * filter: agency, target


** ALL BROWSING PAGES
   * filter mechanisms with onchange events (Discuss with Manuel)

** All VIEW PAGES
  * Implement table style for TEXTFIELDS (or make breaks)


** Search pages for space missions / observatories (JUNE 2011)
  * according to use cases and telecon inputs
  * wavelength searchable? (maybe dropdown for specific ranges)
  * colorization and listing in browsing pages (filters above)
  * search with GPS data!


* E-Mail functionality for ADD / EDIT notification

* Add JQUERY Tooltips where user help is necessary (Questionnaire)
  * http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/tooltip/default.html
  * input fields format: web addresses, latitude, longitude,
    research areas, targets, instrument properties,
    camera properties, sensor properties, science goals, ..
  * input fields convention on: address, phone number
  * wavelength ranges (format documentation)
  * delete last sensor (remove name of sensor and it will be deleted)
  * other research areas => research comments
  * UI FRAMEWORK: QPHP http://qphp.net/demo/ oder JQueryUI
    => research area / targets list (Data Grid / Selectable Rows)

* Refactor all Javascript in functions.js
  * dynamic row adding routines (redundancy)
  * refactor the double hidden_fields in CreateUpdate (Sensors)
  * maybe use -- again in remove fields

* Refactor classes in observatory.php, spacemission.php
  * MVC Pattern implementieren
    * VIEWS (all access through DAO) / CONTROLLER (frontcontroller)
  * ORM Pattern implementieren für die models
  	* DAO / Object => abstract base class (singleton)

* ADD all entries from OLD Matrix, inlcuding the new entries from UCL (if missing)
  * extra work! (take old excel list as support)
