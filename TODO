  * update input_descriptions.txt (new research areas, more description)
  * Doxygen Information for new library classes etc.


* Running Database
  * Review Science Goals (Robert, Manuel)
   [OK] Rewrite entries of europlanet_na1 database
 	 [OK] comments to new fields (remove unnecessary comment fields: instrument comments)
 	 [OK] old telescope types to new instrument types


* Development Database
  [OK] improve hidden fields / additional information (remove not necessary)
  [HIGH PRIORITY] remove OTHER from Telescope Types / Instrument Types
  * introduce JOINS where necessary and usable


[LOW PRIORITY] Introduce Questionnaire form (entries must be approved afterwards) (JUNE 2011)
  * very user friendly! tooltips necessary (UI)
  * switch of all OTHER options (research areas etc.)
  * maybe modify database (use a second one OR make flags)
  * implement a state-of-the-art CAPTCHA

* Input form for observatories
  * add other targets (db functionality)
  * error labels for diameter (and other inputs) must be better!
  [HIGH PRIORITY] wavelength (written text? like radio, near-infrared..)
    [OK] autocompleter + db table (acronym / name)
    * take only necessary jquery UI scripts + css (fix it!)
    * DOESNT WORK when something is already in the input field (maybe because of missing delimiter ",")
  * spatial resolution => format?
  * spectral resolution => format?
  * remove last telescope => empty fields
  * remove last instrument => empty fields
  * PARTNER OBSERVATORIES => make intelligent linkage! (e.g. autocompleter)
  * reorder comment fields locations in input form!

* Input validation in JQUERY for observatories (see comments in add.php)
  * other target - MANDATORY!
  * telescope name - MANDATORY?
  * telescope type - MANDATORY?
  * instrument name - MANDATORY?
  * instrument type - MANDATORY?
  * check for type of values (critical review)!


* Input form for space missions
  * add other targets (db functionality)
  * sensor type? => dropdown from PDAP types? -> extensible?
  * field of view, resolution, measured => format?
  * range_begin, range_end => high precision float?
  * remove last sensor => empty fields
  * Add validation for OTHER science goals with inline error label
  * autocompleter for sensor type

* Input validation in JQUERY for space missions (see comments in add.php)
  * other target - MANDATORY!
  * sensor name - MANDATORY (array => THIS IS AN OPEN ISSUE!)
  * science goals are MANDATORY! (required)
  * validation for sensor web_address (URL)
  * check for type of values (critical review)!

* ALL INPUT FORMS:
  * Add validation for existing names for all OTHER
