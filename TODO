* Introduce clean_num() for high precision values in browse.php or models
  * diameter_m, wavelength_begin, wavelength_end
  
* Introduce Questionnaire form (entries must be approved afterwards)
  * very user friendly! tooltips necessary (UI)
  * maybe modify database (use a second one)

* Input form for observatories
  * add other targets (db functionality)
  * error labels for diameter (and other inputs) must be better!
  * wavelength (written text? like radio, near-infrared..)
    * autocompleter + db table (acronym / name)
    * take only necessary jquery UI scripts + css
  * spatial resolution => format?
  * spectral resolution => format?
  * remove last telescope => empty fields
  * remove last instrument => empty fields
  * toggle table of instruments [OK]
  * autocompleter for telescope name / instrument name
  
* Input validation in JQUERY for observatories (see comments in add.php)
  * other target - MANDATORY!
  * telescope name - MANDATORY?
  * telescope type - MANDATORY?
  * instrument name - MANDATORY?
  * instrument type - MANDATORY?
  * check for type of values (critical review)!
  * autocompleter for sensor type


* Input form for space missions
  * add other targets (db functionality)
  * sensor type? => dropdown from PDAP types? -> extensible?
  * field of view, resolution, measured => format?
  * range_begin, range_end => high precision float?
  * remove last sensor => empty fields
  * Add validation for OTHER science goals with inline error label
  
* Input validation in JQUERY for space missions (see comments in add.php)
  * other target - MANDATORY!
  * sensor name - MANDATORY (array => THIS IS AN OPEN ISSUE!)
  * science goals are MANDATORY! (required)
  * validation for sensor web_address (URL)
  * check for type of values (critical review)!
  
** ALL INPUT FORMS:
   * Add validation for existing names for all OTHER 

   
* Browsing pages for observatories
  * according to telecon inputs (standard / detail pages)
  * USE GEOHACK FOR GPS: http://toolserver.org/~geohack/ (WGS84) [OK]
  * separate display for Telescope types / Instrument types [OK]
  * colorization of different observatories
  * show creation / modification date
  * links to the partner observatories (how to manage this?)
  
* Browsing pages for space missions
  * according to telecon inputs (standard / detail pages)
  * don't forget to display agencies details
  * colorization of different agencies
  * show creation / modification date

 
** ALL BROWSING PAGES
   * how to handle values, that are not given? (lat/long etc.) [OK]
   * filter mechanisms with onchange events
    
    
* Search pages for space missions / observatories
  * according to use cases and telecon inputs
  * wavelength searchable? (maybe dropdown for specific ranges)
  * colorization and listing in browsing pages (filters above)
  
  
* E-Mail functionality for ADD / EDIT notification
  * add_obs/spa_keys => notification as array

* E-Mail functionality for thrown ERROR (make a function)
  * summary of thrown error
  

* Add JQUERY Tooltips where user help is necessary (Questionnaire)
  * http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/tooltip/default.html
  * input fields format: web addresses, latitude, longitude,
    research areas, targets, instrument properties, 
    camera properties, sensor properties, science goals, ..
  * wavelength ranges (format documentation)
  * delete last sensor (remove name of sensor and it will be deleted)
    
* Refactor all Javascript in functions.js
  * dynamic row adding routines (redundancy)
  
* Refactor classes in observatory.php, spacemission.php
  * MVC Pattern implementieren
    * VIEWS (all access through DAO) / CONTROLLER (frontcontroller)

  	* DAO / Object => abstract base class (singleton)

* ADD all entries from OLD Matrix, inlcuding the new entries from UCL (if missing)
  * extra work! (take old excel list as support)
