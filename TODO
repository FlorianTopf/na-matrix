  * remove functionality for science goals for the moment (add, show, spacemission)


* Running Database
  * Review Science Goals / Research Areas (Robert, Manuel)
   * Move camera_properties to instruments (after field_of_view column) [OK]
   * comments will be the last column of instruments [OK]
   * Introduce new instrument_type CAMERA [OK]
   * Rewrite entries of europlanet_na1 database
 	 * camera properties to instrument=>camera [OK]
 	 * comments to new fields (remove unnecessary comment fields:
 	    instrument comments)
 	 * old telescope types to new instrument types

* Development Database
  * hidden_fields, camera_properties, additional_information (ID must be unique) [OK]
  * Every table needs to have a PRIMARY KEY [OK]
    * identifiying relationships for relational tables [OK]
  * introduce primary key for relational tables with 2 foreign keys (for ORM) [OK]
  * improve hidden fields / additional information (remove not necessary)
  * remove OTHER from Telescope Types / Instrument Types / Antenna Types!
  
  
* Introduce clean_num() for high precision values in browse.php or models
  * diameter_m, wavelength_begin, wavelength_end
  

* Input form for observatories
  * add other targets (db functionality)
  * error labels for diameter (and other inputs) must be better!
  * wavelength (written text? like radio, near-infrared..)
    * autocompleter + db table (acronym / name)
    * take only necessary jquery UI scripts + css
  * spatial resolution => format?
  * spectral resolution => format?
  * remove last telescope => empty fields
  * remove last instrument => empty fields
  * toggle table of instruments [OK]
  
* Input validation in JQUERY for observatories (see comments in add.php)
  * other target - MANDATORY!
  * telescope name - MANDATORY?
  * telescope type - MANDATORY?
  * instrument name - MANDATORY?
  * instrument type - MANDATORY?
  * check for type of values (critical review)!


* Input form for space missions
  * add other targets (db functionality)
  * sensor type? => dropdown from PDAP types? -> extensible?
  * field of view, resolution, measured => format?
  * range_begin, range_end => high precision float?
  * remove last sensor => empty fields
  * Add validation for OTHER science goals with inline error label
  
* Input validation in JQUERY for space missions (see comments in add.php)
  * other target - MANDATORY!
  * sensor name - MANDATORY (array => THIS IS AN OPEN ISSUE!)
  * science goals are MANDATORY! (required)
  * validation for sensor web_address (URL)
  * check for type of values (critical review)!
  
** ALL INPUT FORMS:
   * Add validation for existing names for all OTHER 

   
* Browsing pages for observatories
  * according to telecon inputs (standard / detail pages)
  * USE GEOHACK FOR GPS: http://toolserver.org/~geohack/ (WGS84) [OK]
  * separate display for Telescope types / Instrument types [OK]
  * colorization of different observatories
  * show creation / modification date
  * links to the partner observatories (how to manage this?)
  
* Browsing pages for space missions
  * according to telecon inputs (standard / detail pages)
  * don't forget to display agencies details
  * colorization of different agencies
  * show creation / modification date

 
** ALL BROWSING PAGES
   * how to handle values, that are not given? (lat/long etc.) [OK]
   * filter mechanisms with onchange events
    
    
* Search pages for space missions / observatories
  * according to use cases and telecon inputs
  * wavelength searchable? (maybe dropdown for specific ranges)
  * colorization and listing in browsing pages (filters above)
  
  
* E-Mail functionality for ADD / EDIT notification

* E-Mail functionality for thrown ERROR (make a function)
  

* Add JQUERY Tooltips where user help is necessary
  * input fields format: web addresses, latitude, longitude,
    research areas, targets, instrument properties, 
    camera properties, sensor properties, science goals, ..
  * wavelength ranges (format documentation)
  * delete last sensor (remove name of sensor and it will be deleted)
    
* Refactor all Javascript in functions.js
  * dynamic row adding routines (redundancy)
  
* Refactor classes in observatory.php, spacemission.php
  * MVC Pattern implementieren (show_entry.php, add.php etc.)
    * autoloader is in Controller
  * ORM Pattern implementieren für die models

* ADD all entries from OLD Matrix, inlcuding the new entries from UCL (if missing)
  * extra work! (take old excel list as support)
